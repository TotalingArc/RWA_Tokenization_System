## RWA_Tokenization_System
A permissionless real-world asset tokenization framework: mint an ERC-721 NFT for property, verify its market value via Chainlink Functions, store attested valuations in a PoR feed, and issue a 1:1 ERC-20 stablecoin (HouseDAI) backed by the locked NFT, with optional on-chain redemption and DEX liquidity.
